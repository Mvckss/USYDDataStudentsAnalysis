Overview
As an international student in Sydney, I really care about two things:
  1. How do I make new friends from people all around the world, both at uni and in life?
  2. What are some reasonable rent prices (considering commute time to uni)?

However, as a data enthusiast, I also ask myself another two questions:
  1. Since I'm in USYD's introductory data science unit, DATA1001, how do others feel about data, or how much are they interested in data science?
  2. Is there a difference between domestic and international student's data interest?

All of these questions led to this data report. I aim to answer key questions related to social life, rent prices, and student interest in data science. By leveraging Pandas (Python) and R, this analysis provides insights into both academic and non-academic aspects of students' lives.

Tools & Libraries Used
- Python: Primarily using Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn for visualizations.
- R: Additional statistical analysis and data wrangling, with ggplot2 for any R-specific visualizations.

Data Sources
- USYD Surveys: Collected anonymous feedback from students in the DATA1001 unit regarding their interest in data science.
- Rent Listings: Scraped data from property websites to analyze rent prices and proximity to USYD.
- Commute Data: Google Maps API for commute time estimates.
